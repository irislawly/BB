Our app is Booking&Bulking, a lifestyle and scheduling app for gym-goers, to be able to reserve a timeslot at their local gym. So to reserve, users will choose a date and a 2-hour time interval which will allow them to view the number of people that have also booked that time slot.  Users will also get a calendar to track their booked dates with the equipment they will be using.
As well, we have a web app for gym owners to add their gym and data such as equipment and contact information to the mobile app.
